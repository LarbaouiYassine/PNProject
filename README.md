Customizable resource of codes developed by Yassine Larbaoui for individual uses.

This is a customizable resource of codes developed by Yassine Larbaoui for individual interests of finding or verifying Mersenne Prime numbers.
These codes are independent from being slaved by Super Infinity Calculator for collaborative processing through networks, which enables individuals to use these codes freely.
In order to use codes able to find prime numbers with lengths exceeding 100,000,000 digits and even exceeding 1,000,000,000 you may contact Yassine Larbaoui on GitHub
